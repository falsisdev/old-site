        I guess I should start with programming first. I am a Front-End
        developer who develops full-stack projects because sometimes uses
        back-end, but is far from being a full-stack developer due to
        shortcomings in back-end. I am developing web
        <NuxtLink to="/projects" class="text-primary">projects</NuxtLink>
        but I want to focus on Android application development in the future.
        That's why learning Kotlin is one of my goals but I am postponing it for
        later because I will have difficulty using Android Studio on my current
        computer. In short, I am currently a Front-End Web Developer. You can
        see the technologies i use

        Rock, Turkish Rock, Metal, Alternative Metal, Numetal etc.
        <br />

        My main language is Turkish, my English level is about B2, I started
        learning German but it's still A1 or A2 for me. I can understand and
        speak A1 level Japanese too, besides I can read Kana (Hiragana &
        Katakana). Because of the language family of my main language. I can
        understand over 90% Oghuz languages such as Gagauz, Azerbaijani or
        Turkmen. I'm a Turkish muslim. So I'm familiar with Arabic alphabet too
        but I can't read it fr.

        When it comes to talk about the series and movies, I like things that
        surprise me when I watch them, like Plot Twists. In this sense, I can
        watch any series or anime set in any period. I even watch sitcoms, even
        though they interest me less than others. I watched a lot of anime. You
        can check it out on

        Regarding sports, I like to play and watch football. I am a Fenerbahçe
        fan. I don't support a team in the city I live in. I don't support any
        team in Europe other than Real Madrid and maybe Benfica. My card, which
        I need to enter the match as a spectator, is stamped Göztepe and I also
        have an expired Altınordu card. But I don't support them fr. I also like
        to play and watch basketball. I like the Euroleague more than the NBA
        because I prefer tactical games to show. I'm a huge Magnus Carlsen fan
        and I like to play chess. And Finally, I play billiards sometimes.
